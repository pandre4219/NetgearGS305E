i made a script to calculate the checksum unfortunatly it dosnt apply to the whole fw
it is posible to delete(fill with 0x00) and change parts of the fw by calculating the 
checksum of the affected part and substract/add them from the original checksum. to do 
that just save the deleted part as a file and use the script substract calculated chksum
from original checksum and if for added stuff just add the checksums. For a update via 
Web fw updater the header and header checksum have to be correct. For that just save the
header(first 20 bytes) as a file (containing magic_number, length, NOT header_chksum 
(just fill with 0x00 or leave it out), payload_chksum and reserved) and calculate then 
the header checksum can be calculated by the script. The file i uploaded here 
(GS305E_V1.0.0.16test.bin) was a test how much i could strip the fw with the checksum 
still beeing checkt as correct. Do     NOT    uploade this fw if you dont have console
access to the switch, it will accept the fw and get bricked. If you do have console access
and for what ever reason decided to flash the fw you will see that the switch is in an 
bootloop you just have to press ESC for the switch to enter download mode and the you
can install a new fw.


---------------checksum script-----------------
the script needs xxd to run 
it takes one file as input and calculates the checksum of the file
may update the script in the future
