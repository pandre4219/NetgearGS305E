magic_number is constand change results in unsuccsesfull uploade
	An error occurred while updating the file. Select a valid file and try again.

chainging length (value) results in unsucsesfull uploade
	An error occurred while updating the file. Select a valid file and try again.

chainging header_chksum results in unsuccsesfull uploade
	An error occurred while updating the file. Select a valid file and try again.

chainging payload_chksum results in unsuccsesfull uploade
	An error occurred while updating the file. Select a valid file and try again.

chainging reserved results in unsuccsesfull uploade
	An error occurred while updating the file. Select a valid file and try again.

changing anything after 0x13 (after reserved) isnt noticed while uploading
	conclusion: the first 20 bytes of the file get checked while uploading
	followup tests:
		uploading random picture: rejectet
		uploading file only containing the 20 bytes: instand rejection with error:
			192.168.0.239 didnâ€™t send any data.
		 		i thought this would work :(
		uploading firmware using the 20 bytes of the old one: succsessful
			after printing header i noticed it dosn't get updated
		resize the 20 bytes file and added a lot of 0's: successful
			conclusion certan file length requiert
			tested lengths:
				0x1400 successful
				0x1000 successful
				0x0420 successful
				0x0100 not successful
				0x0200 not successful
				0x0300 successsful
				0x0250 not successful
				0x0280 not successful
				0x0290 not successful
				0x02ff successful
				0x02f0 successful
				0x02a0 not successful
				0x02b0 successful
				0x02af successful
				0x02a8 not successful
				0x02a9 not successful
				0x02ab not successful
				0x02ad not successful
				0x02ae successful
			conclusion file has to be longer than 0x2AD bytes and so 
			at least 0x2AE bytes long
				may be different using other operation systems and browsers
			tested with both headers: length is header independent
		file length gets checked befor checksum

testing to brutefoce valid headers

Codeing the script took way longer than i thought
ok so lets get the hash
2m and 26.002s later and the hash is 0x000004fd

header_chksum gets calculated by adding every byte of magic_number, length, payload_chksum and reserved
magic_number seams to not be changeable
chksum for only magic_number is 0x0000019C

same probably applies for payload_chksum
