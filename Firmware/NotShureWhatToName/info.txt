ran the switch wit the bootloader only (onlyBootloader.bin) and installed a 
fresh fw (GS305E_V1.0.0.16.bin) resulting in the file prettyCleanFW.bin
i was able to locate where the parts of the fresh fw get placed by compairing the 3 files
nothing realy spezial exept for the WebKitFormBoundary which gets send while
sending the new fw to the switch. Folowing information were gained using burpsuit.
