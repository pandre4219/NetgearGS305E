ran the switch wit the bootloader only (onlyBootloader.bin) and installed a 
fresh fw (GS305E_V1.0.0.16.bin) resulting in the file prettyCleanFW.bin
i was able to locate where the parts of the fresh fw get placed by compairing the 3 files
nothing realy spezial exept for the WebKitFormBoundary which gets send while
sending the new fw to the switch. Folowing information were gained using burpsuit.

At the current state it is unclear where "WebKitFormBoundaryu0MQXosZb2ERBSG0" is generated


Current state:


in tree.js there is
	str += CreateButtons('button','Apply','submitForm()','btn_Apply','on');

and for submitForm() there is
	function submitForm()
	{
	var form1=window.frames['maincontent'].document.forms[0];
	var ip = window.frames['maincontent'].document.getElementById("Ip_Address");
	if(checkIPv4Address(ip) == 0)
	{
	alert("IP address: " + ip + " is not a valid IP address.")
	ip.value="";
	ip.focus();
	return;
	}
	form1.submit();
	}

for checkIPv4Address to be true i can use checkIPv4Address({value:"0.0.0.0"})

ok i have no clue 

just did some test and research and the WebKitFormBoundary is completly irrelevant(also for the checksum)
